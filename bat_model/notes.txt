This model was designed in September 2021.

I came up with it entirely myself, no outside help or tech used.

The model in the pictures was done with 8 inch x 8 inch vellum paper. I'd like to produce a couple more in spookier colors too, since the white one is really a development model.

How do you copyright stuff? I want this model and the accompanying instructions to be my copyright... lol
